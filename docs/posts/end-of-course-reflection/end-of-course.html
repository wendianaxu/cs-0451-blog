<section id="csci-0451-end-of-course-reflection" class="level1">
<h1>CSCI 0451: End-Of-Course Reflection</h1>
<p>[your name here]</p>
<section id="the-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-data">The Data</h2>
<p>In this section I’ll ask you to fill in some data. You don’t have to give precise numbers – approximate, conversational responses are fine. For example, when I ask “how often did you attend class,” good answers include “almost always,” “I missed three times,” “about 75% of the time,” “not as often as I wanted,” etc.</p>
<section id="presence-in-class" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="presence-in-class">Presence in Class</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>How often did you attend class? (e.g.&nbsp;“almost always,” “I missed three times,” etc.)</em> I attended all classes.</li>
<li><em>How often did you take notes on the core readings ahead of the class period?</em> I always read the readings ahead of class and took notes sometimes.</li>
<li><em>How often were you <strong>prepared</strong> to present the daily warm-up exercise to your team, even if you weren’t actually called?</em> I was always prepared to present.</li>
<li><em>How many times did you <strong>actually</strong> present the daily warm-up to your team?</em> About 1/4 of the times.</li>
<li><em>How many times did you ask your team for help while presenting the daily warm-up?</em> For a few times.</li>
<li><em>How often did you learn something new from a teammate’s presentation of the daily warm-up?</em> I felt I learned something new for most of the times.</li>
<li><em>How often did you help a teammate during the daily warm-up presentation?</em> For a few times.</li>
<li><em>Did you contribute a question for our guest speaker?</em> Yes.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="presence-outside-of-class" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="presence-outside-of-class">Presence Outside of Class</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>How often did you attend Student Hours or Peer Help?</em> About once a week to every two weeks.</li>
<li><em>How often did you ask for or receive help from your fellow students?</em> About once a week.</li>
<li><em>Did you regularly participate in a study group outside class?</em> Yes.</li>
<li><em>How often did you post questions or answers in Slack?</em> I didn’t post questions or answers in Slack.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="assignments-and-effort" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assignments-and-effort">Assignments and Effort</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>How many blog posts did you submit?</em> 8</li>
<li><em>How many of your submitted blog posts are at each of the following feedback stages?</em>
<ul>
<li><em>No revisions suggested:</em> 6</li>
<li><em>Revisions useful:</em> 0</li>
<li><em>Revisions encouraged:</em> 0</li>
<li><em>Incomplete:</em> 0</li>
<li><em>Haven’t received feedback:</em> 2</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Roughly how many hours per week did you spend on this course outside of class?</em> Around 7-10 hours</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="what-you-learned" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-you-learned">What You Learned</h2>
<p><em>At the beginning of the course, you may have expressed an interest in focusing a little extra on one or two of the following four categories:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Theory</em></strong>: <em>mathematical descriptions of frameworks and algorithms.</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Implementation</em></strong>: <em>effective coding and use of tools in order to implement efficient machine learning algorithms.</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Experimentation</em></strong>: <em>performing experiments to assess the performance of algorithms and clearly communicating about the results.</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Social responsibility</em></strong>: <em>critical analysis of sources of bias and harm in machine learning algorithms; theoretical formulations of fairness and bias</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Did you choose to focus on any of these categories? If so, what did you do in order to pursue your interest?</em></p>
<p>I chose to focus on <strong>experimentation</strong> and <strong>social responsibility</strong>. For both topics, I have completed most blog posts that primarily focused on them, such as penguin classification, bias auditing, and deep music classification. I put extra effort into some of these blog posts by discussing beyond what is required. I have also focused on these two topics in my final project, where we explored different model and feature choices and included a discussion of potential ethical implications of our model.</p>
</section>
<section id="reflecting-on-goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reflecting-on-goals">Reflecting on Goals</h2>
<p><em>For each of the categories below, replace the “[your response here]” cell with 1-2 paragraphs in which you reflect on the following questions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In what ways did you <strong>meet</strong> your goals from the beginning of the course? Be specific: explain what the goal was and what you did to meet it.</em></li>
<li><em>In what ways did you <strong>not meet</strong> your goals from the beginning of the course? Be specific: explain what the goal was and what the gap was between what you aspired to and what happened.</em></li>
<li><em>If there’s any <strong>context</strong> you want to share about how you fared relative to your goals, please do!</em></li>
</ul>
<section id="blog-posts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blog-posts">Blog Posts</h3>
<p>I have met most of my goals for the blog posts. I submitted blog posts in most weeks during the semester, submitted no more thant two blog posts later than the best-by date, and revised all of them that I have received feedback so far to the “no revisions suggested” level.</p>
<p>For my last goal of going above and beyond in at least two blog posts, I think that I haven’t met the level that I expected when setting the goal because I didn’t explore any new visualization choices to communicate results. However, I did include more discussions in some of my blog posts, so I will consider this goal to be met.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-presence-participation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-presence-participation">Course Presence (Participation)</h3>
<p>I have met all my goals for participation. I completed all required readings and most, though not all optional readings related to my areas of focus. I was prepared for all warmup activities. I prepared a question for our guest speaker. I often worked with classmates together outside of class. I did not attend office hours or peer help hours as much as I wanted during the first of the semester, but I have been there more for the last few weeks of the semester.</p>
</section>
<section id="project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project">Project</h3>
<p>I have met all of my project goals. We submitted all major milestones on time and I completed all my designated work on time. We set up regular times to meet each week and had clear and timely communications. I drafted designated sections of the project blog post and prepared for and delivered designated parts of the presentation.</p>
<p>In addtion to my goals, I also contributed to cleaning up the many notebook files that we created throughout the process and compiling them into our final notebook for the demonstration of our workflow.</p>

<section id="your-proposed-letter-grade" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Your Proposed Letter Grade</h1>
<p><em>Take 15 minutes to look back on your responses in each of the sections above. Then, make a proposal for the letter grade that you feel best reflects your learning, participation, and achievement in CSCI 0451. Here are some soundbytes to help guide your thinking:</em></p>
<p><em>An <strong>A</strong> sounds like:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I am very proud of my time in this course.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I have grown significantly in multiple ways that matter to me.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I am ready to take the theory, techniques, and ideas of this course into my future classes, projects, hobbies, or career.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>A <strong>B</strong> sounds like:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I had some opportunities to learn more, overall I feel good about my time in this course.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I am able to explain some new things or achieve new tasks.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I can see a few ideas from this course that will be relevant for my future classes, projects, hobbies, or career.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>A <strong>C</strong> sounds like:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I often made a good effort, but I missed many opportunities to get more out of my time in this course.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I might be able to complete some new tasks related to the course content, but only with significant further guidance.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I don’t see any ways to take the contents of this course into my future classes, projects, hobbies, or career.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>You might find that some of these soundbytes resonate and other’s don’t! Take some time, see what feels right, and don’t be afraid to celebrate your achievements.</em></p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="aside">Your proposed letter grade in this section should be based purely on demonstrations of learning that you have <strong>already submitted</strong>.</span></div></div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Upon reflection, I feel that my learning, participation, and achievement in CSCI 0451 are best reflected by a grade of</strong> A</p>
